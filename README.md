### Songbird
Ethan Lee

### Project Description:
This project shall serve as a music box capable of playing user designed playlists, capable of handling signals to skip the song, pause it, or end a playlist. These playlists are customizable within the box, utilizing the search bar and the library made during a prior project. Users can see the songs available and hopefully their most played songs.

### Instructions:  ? UPDATE FOR signals
The music files should be already included in the repository, so no downloads are necessary.

The user starts out in the terminal, and after running make compile && make run, will be met with a prompt. "Edit Playlist or Start". The user answers either with (1) or (2).

If the user types (2) and there is no playlist, they will be told to set up a new playlist or that the playlist is empty. Otherwise, the music should play until the playlist is depleted.

If the user types (1), they will be greeted with another prompt. Printed out in the terminal is the library, each song_node indicated by a number. The prompt will ask the user if he/she wants to add (A) or remove (R) from the playlist. Then they will be asked to choose the number corresponding to the music file they want to add/remove. There will be reminders if the music file isn't valid.
